# Object-Oriented-Python-Practice

🐍 Python OOP Practice Assignment:

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python through a practical example involving student data, grades management, and data validation.
It combines class design, data structures, and basic data validation in a clean and modular way.

Project Overview:

This assignment covers:

-Classes & Objects – defining custom objects using Python’s OOP model

-Encapsulation & Methods – creating instance methods to manipulate object data

-Data Structures – working with lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples

-Regular Expressions – basic email validation concept

-Error Handling – demonstrating tuple immutability

Project Structure:
oop_practice.py          # Main Python script

⚙️ How to Run the Script

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-oop-practice.git
cd python-oop-practice


Run the script:

-python oop_practice.py


-No external dependencies are required (only Python standard library).

 Key Concepts Demonstrated
Class Definition (Student)

Attributes: name, email, grades

Methods:

-add_grade() → adds a grade

-average_grade() → computes average grade

-display_info() → prints all student details

-grades_tuple() → returns grades as a tuple

Data Structures:

-Lists → store student grades

-Tuples → demonstrate immutability

-Dictionaries → map emails to Student objects

-Sets → collect unique grades across all students

 Example Features:

-Create multiple Student objects

-Add new grades dynamically

-Calculate averages

-Display info for all students

-Retrieve student by email

-Handle immutable tuple modification errors

🧪 Example Output:
Name: Alice Johnson
Email: alice@example.com
Grades: [85, 90, 78, 89, 94]
Average Grade: 87.20
----------------------------------------
Student found for bob@example.com: Bob Smith
All students’ emails: ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com', 'charlie@example.com']
Unique grades across all students: {70, 75, 78, 80, 85, 88, 89, 90, 92, 94, 95}
Error: Tuples are immutable — you cannot change their contents!

Learning Objectives:

-Understand OOP principles (Encapsulation, Objects, Methods)

-Work with collections efficiently

-Practice data retrieval and mapping

-Learn immutability concepts through tuples

-Gain confidence writing clean, well-documented code
